This is a re-creation of the famous Snake Game 🐍 by Nokia which we loved playing as a Child 😁
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can control the movement of the snake by using the arrow keys:<br>
⬆ Up - Move UP <br>
⬇ Down - Move Down <br>
⬅ Left - Move Left<br>
➡ Right - Move Right<br>
<br>
<br>
The game ends when you hit the wall OR Bite Your own Tail 😅 . So avoid that and try to create a score as high as you can 🦾
<br>
<br>
The project is developed entirely using Python with the help of Turtle Graphics 🐢
